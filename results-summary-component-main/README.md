## Overview

  This is my first project ever using HTML and CSS, very grateful for frontend mentor to provide awesome mini-projects for people to code. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

I first, started with the barebones HTML. Once I finished the HTML I went straight into CSS and began copying the reference photo, it took a minute to figure out how to get gradients and box shadows but overall, was a very quick project and I am proud of it. For responsiveness I used media queries for the first time and I followed the style guide to match everything well. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned alot from building my first project. I learned box shadows, media queries, gradients, hover, and so on. 


### Continued development

I would like to work more on making my code a bit more organized and maybe learn when the right time to use flex and grid. I do struggle with grid and ultimately just end up using grid. I also do want to build full-fledged websites soon for my families business. It would be a good thing to add on my portfolio.
